# Mementor Remake

This repository was intended to recreate only the domain layer of a project I did with some colleagues in 2019. Back
then we didn't quite understood proper OOP (At least at the level of properly modeling a domain that makes sense), and
how to separate out domain from our application (We did it with Spring and we were just deeply coupled with the
framework).

The idea of the project was to create mentoring relationships between employees of the company.
